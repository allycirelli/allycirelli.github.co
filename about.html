            <p>Book clubs are great way to discover new books and discuss them among a group. But what if you’re not interest in reading the book that’s picked? Do you just suck it up and read it anyway? Or maybe you skip this month? </p>
        
            <p>Whichever way you swing it, there’s a way to have more control in deciding what your book club is reading!</p>
    
            <p>Loosely Bound Book Club connects you with other people who have the same enthusiasm about books that you love. </p>

            <p>First you fill out a short form that tells us genres that you’re interested in or o[en to reading. You can select as many genres and topics as you want and you can always go back into your profile and edit your preferences. Every month you view which books are available and from there you select which book that you want to read!</p>
